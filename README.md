# Bus-Tracker
Using a map obtained through the open source platform mapbox, we applied a library to add markers to each bus stop between MIT and the Harvard University. In addition, each marker shows the stop number and the bus stop address.

## Install
1. Fork and download the project.
2. Open index.html file in your browser.

## Roadmap for future improvements.
